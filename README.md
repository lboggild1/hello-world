hello-world
===========
This is the first repo I have created on GitHub. I'm really excited about the idea of a more robust version control system than what we currently use at work. My brain is firing with how this could be used to make my team more efficient!

Looking forward to figuring out how this can be used for text files that aren't a in a CLI format!
